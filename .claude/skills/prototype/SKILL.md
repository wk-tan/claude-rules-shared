I want to prototype something. This is an experimental session — speed over polish.

## Rules for this session

1. **Move fast.** Prioritize getting something working over getting it perfect. Skip boilerplate unless I ask for it.
2. **Keep it contained.** Work in a scratch directory or isolated branch. Do not modify existing production code unless I say so.
3. **Explain trade-offs briefly.** If you take a shortcut, mention it in one line so I know what to clean up later.
4. **Iterate on my feedback.** When I say "change X", just do it — no need to ask for confirmation in prototype mode.
5. **No deployment.** Do not push, deploy, or modify infrastructure. This stays local.

## What I want to try

$ARGUMENTS

If my idea is vague, suggest a minimal starting point and we will iterate from there.
