description: Execute an approved plan phase by phase with stop-gates between each phase
---

I am starting an implementation session from an approved plan.

## Rules for this session

1. **Phase by phase execution.** Complete one phase at a time. After each phase, stop and wait for my go/no-go before proceeding to the next phase.
2. **Do not recreate existing resources.** Ask me what already exists before creating anything. If I've stated what exists, trust that.
3. **Error handling.** If you encounter an error, stop and show me the error. Do not attempt a fix unless I ask you to.
4. **Environment.** Confirm which GCP project and environment (sandbox/staging/production) we are targeting before executing any commands.
5. **No plan changes.** Follow the plan as written. If you see an issue with the plan, flag it — do not silently deviate. I will decide whether to adjust.
