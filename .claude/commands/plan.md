description: Start a planning session using the planning-session skill and template
---

This is a planning session only. Do not execute commands, generate application code, or create infrastructure files.

Load the `planning-session` skill and use its reference template as the plan structure.

Fill in sections only as I provide information — do not assume or invent details I haven't confirmed. Flag missing information as open questions.

Do not proceed to implementation. That happens in a separate session with the approved plan.

Here is what I'm thinking about: $ARGUMENTS

If my description is vague or incomplete, start by asking clarifying questions to help me shape the objective before filling in the template.
